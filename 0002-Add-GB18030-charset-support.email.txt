Thank you Wang for all your efforts and the information you sent. I 
understand your argument in some sense. What I'd really like to see is 
that all of GB18030 is fully handled, and so be confident that there is 
full support for it.

I agree on your point of not having GB18030 be a posting character set. 
At least not at this time.

I am more than happy ot learn about and investigate this issue with you.
I will look for sample files encoded in GB18030 to see how much of the 
support is already there, and how much more work needs to be done. If you 
find one (just like the messages you sent) I'll be happy to take a look at 
it too.

Hi, Eduardo

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030), GB18030 
is a superset of ASCII, it is also a superset of GB2312. GB18030 also 
maintains compatibility with Windows Codepage 936, sometimes known as GBK, 
which is Microsoft's extended version of GB2312.

- GB2312:  published in the year 1980. has 7445 characters

- GBK:     published in the year 1995. has 21886 characters,
	 as an extension of GB2312

- GB18030-2000: published in the year 2000. has 27533 characters

- GB18030-2005: published in the year 2005. has 70244 characters

Since GB18030 was published in 2000 and 2005, I think this is why this
code was not added before.

Basically, there are only 3500 Chinese characters frequently used in daily 
life. According to some statistics, 1000 Chinese characters can cover
92% written information, 2000 Chinese characters can cover 98%, 3000
Chinese characters can cover up to 99%.

GB is short for Guojia(国家,States) Biaozhun(标准,Standard), and it's
only used in China mainland. For example, Taiwan uses Big5.

Most email clients uses GB2312 or UTF-8 for Chinese. Only seldom email
client use GB18030 as default charset. So I think it's enough to add only
display support for GB18030, and there is no need to add Posting
Character Set support for it.


I don't think I can get you a full testcase contains 20000+ characters, 
but you can refer to the code in `iconv`. You can find some specification 
in `libiconv-1.14/lib/gb18030.h`.


Later, I will try to send you three email encoded in GB18030/GBK/UTF-8, so 
you can have a test.

GB18030 is a Chinese charset, basically it completely equals to GBK.
Some mail provider use GB18030 like QQ Mail,
which has large number of users in China for now.
